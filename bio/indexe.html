                                    <p>My name is Titarenko Mikhail and I was born on April 23, 1996 in the city of Donetsk. From my earliest years my mother, grandmother and grandfather were engaged in my education.</p>
                                    <p>My mum is a signalman. In her spare time, my mother helped me with my studies very much. Therefore, since 2 years, I knew all the letters.</p>
                                    <p>My grandfather is a miner. All his life he worked at the mine. When mom was at work, I spent most of her time with him.</p>
                                    <p>My grandmother is a tax inspector. In my memory is that she worked a lot and, even coming home, she was continuing to make reports.</p>
                                    <p>I don't have any sisters or brothers, but my cousin with confidence can be called my brother. We spent all our childhood together. He is currently studying at the DonNASA as architect.</p>
                                    <p>His mother, my aunt, has mastered several professions: a signalman, a tutor, a hairdresser. In addition, she is always cook very well, and I have always visited her with pleasure. She always make me feel very free and comfortable with her.</p>
                                    <p>In 5 years I was given to a kindergarten. I was very lucky with it. I was in the group where I studied choreography, english language, and there was also visits to the computer class and pool. Since then I have been attracted to my computer. But swimming in the pool I didn't like, because the children began to splash with the water that fell into the eyes, and because of this I had an unpleasant sensation. Visits to the kindergarden had to be refused, because I was often sick.</p>
                                    <p>In 2002 I went to the first class of Donetsk general school №149. </p>
                                    <p>In the elementary school I had a great teacher Grebenyuk Zinaida Ivanivna, with who I've always liked to talk at the breaks. At school I was calm, but a sociable child.</p>
                                    <p>From the fifth grade of study were already various teachers. Especially I liked the lessons of geography of Azarova Galina Sergeevna, history — Roshchina Larisa Oleksandrivna and Romanenko Nadezhda Nikolaevna, English — Managarova Olena Nikolaevna, chemistry — Kizko Valentina Ivanovna and, of course, physic — Lysenko Marina Mikhailovna, who was my class teacher in my senior classes and became for my classmates and me the second mother.</p>
                                    <p>In those years I was fond of embroidery.</p>
                                    <p>In high school I studied with the specialization <q lang="en">Economy</q>.</p>
                                    <p>Throughout the study at the school, I constantly participated in many school competitions and took prize-winning places.</p>
                                    <p>I studied very well, so at the end of my studies I received a certificate with honors and the gold medal.</p>
                                    <div class="h5">Professional formation</div>
                                    <p>After a long preparation for external independent evaluation in 2013, I successfully passed it. By this moment, I had already knew that I would go to the IT specialty in DonNTU.</p>
                                    <p>In the first year I encountered with an insurmountable obstacle as for me — Mathematical Analysis. However, diligent work on mastering this subject with my groupmates, as well as the help and lectures of Anatoly Efremovich Skvortsov, had done their job. The subject was delivered.</p>
                                    <p>A pleasant surprise for me was the physical education lessons with the option of choosing a section. So I got into the DonNTU's pool. By that moment I wasn't able to swim at all, but thanks to Kharkivskiy Vadim Anatolievich, this shortcoming was quickly eliminated :) Now I can't imagine my life without this sport.</p>
                                    <p>At the beginning of the training, I also took part in a geographic quiz about Indonesia and took second place. The ceremony for the prizes was held in Kremenchug, Poltava, where the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Indonesia in Ukraine, Ninik Kun Naryati arrived. From her hand I was awarded. Especially I remembered the performance of Indonesian children.</p>
                                    <p>During my studies at DonNTU, I have listened to many interesting and useful lectures. Especially I would like to highlight Datsun Natalia Nikolaevna, Vovk Olga Leonidovna, Morgaylov Dmitriy Dmitrievich and Kolomoytseva Irina Aleksandrovna, who became the scientific supervisor of my bachelor thesis.</p>
                                    <p>From the 4th year I started to work by specialty, which allowed me to consolidate theoretical knowledge and to get professional work experience.</p>
                                    <p>Despite the fact that the education for me was quite complicated, I successfully received a bachelor's degree with honors.</p>
                                    <p>After that, I decided to continue my studies at the DonNTU at the magistracy where I'm studying at the moment.</p>
                                    <p>My scientific supervisor of the master's thesis became Skvortsov Anatoliy Yefremovych, and I chose Kolomoytseva Iryna Aleksandrovna as my scientific adviser.</p>
                                    <p>At the same time, I became interested in the Spanish language and began studying it.</p>
                                    <div class="h5">Goals, plans and vision of the future</div>
                                    <p>The main goal for me today is the successful completion of the Master's program. In addition, I consider it necessary to pass the international exams IELTS for English and DELE for Spanish to increase the job opportunities. I also plan to improve my professional skills so that in the future I will have the opportunity to start my own business in the professional field.</p>
